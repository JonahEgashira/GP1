# Abstract

# Background
## Virtual Environment as a Training Platform
Virtual Environments (VEs) provide a safe, realistic, and interactive learning environment with the opportunity for repeated practice. However, a relatively small number of studies have explored motor skill acquisition and transfer from virtual to real environments [1]. Moreover, even fewer studies have used Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) as VE.

## Retention of Motor Skill
Newly acquired motor skills become stabilized through consolidation, which represents the process by which motor skills are transformed from an initial fragile state to a more solid state. Motor skills can be modified and enhanced through exposure to increased sensorimotor variability [2]. However, whether inducing variability in VEs enhances transfer to real-world tasks is unknown.


# Problem
Does motor learning in VEs transfer to real environment, and does increasing variability in VEs enhance transfer and retention in real world?

# Hypothesis
1. Motor learning in VE using HMD transfers to real environment.
2. Inducing variability in motor learning under VE enhances transfer and retention in the real world.

# Approach
## Motor task and Participants
In this research, darts will be used as a motor learning task.
